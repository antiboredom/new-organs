    <h2 class="question">About The New Organs</h2>

    <p>Ever had the feeling that the internet knows more about you than you think it should? Perhaps you’ve mentioned something in conversation that later appeared in an online advertisement, or noticed that web content changes based on your physical location.</p>

    <p><em>The New Organs</em> is a project to gather, archive and investigate the theories and realities of corporate surveillance. Over the coming month we’ll be collecting stories about weird online ads &mdash; ads that seem to know too much, as well as your theories of why you might be seeing them. Using these stories as a starting point, we’ll investigate the details of how internet companies monitor, exploit and manipulate us in an attempt to understand how surveillance capitalism operates. Project findings will be presented as a series of video works and an online archive that chronicles this era of corporate surveillance.</p>

    <p>If you’ve seen anything online that strikes you as unusual, invasive or creepy, we invite you to contribute your story to the <a href="https://neworgans.net">neworgans.net</a>, or via email at <a href="mailto:contact@neworgans.net">contact@neworgans.net</a>.</p>
